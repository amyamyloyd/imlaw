      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Canonical Field Registry Implementation into subtasks covering: 1) Core canonical field data model and storage, 2) Field mapping system between form fields and canonical fields, 3) API endpoints for managing canonical fields, 4) Field suggestion algorithm based on patterns and names, and 5) Integration with form schemas.",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it's the central mapping system connecting different forms and versions. It requires sophisticated matching algorithms, handling field variants and aliases, and maintaining relationships between canonical fields and their various representations across forms. The suggestion algorithm adds significant complexity."

      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a flexible data model that can store varied client information mapped to canonical fields. The complexity comes from supporting partial updates, handling nested data structures, managing repeatable sections, and providing efficient retrieval for form filling. It has dependencies on both the MongoDB setup and canonical field registry."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the PDF Form Filler Service into subtasks covering: 1) PDF template management system, 2) Field mapping between client data and PDF fields, 3) Implementation of PDF filling functionality, 4) Handling of repeatable sections and arrays, and 5) API endpoints for generating filled PDFs.",
      "reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the challenges of programmatically filling PDF forms with proper formatting. It requires handling various field types (text, checkboxes, radio buttons), managing repeatable sections, and ensuring proper positioning. PDF libraries can be temperamental, and government forms often have complex structures requiring special handling."

      "reasoning": "This task involves creating a complex React application that dynamically generates forms based on schemas. The complexity comes from converting between schema formats, handling pre-filled fields, implementing validation, supporting partial saves, and creating an intuitive UI. The dynamic nature of the forms and the need to handle various field types add significant complexity."

      "reasoning": "This task requires working with Atlassian's Forge platform, which has its own learning curve and constraints. The complexity comes from embedding the React form system within Jira, handling authentication between systems, and integrating with Jira workflows. The task depends on the React form generation system being completed first."
